this project is the 3rd project in cpp course (huji) - implements a generic operations on Matrices 
compiled as a static library for efficient use. the functions implemented for the same purpose as the
Eigen c++ template library for linear algebra 

Matrix.hpp - contains the templateb functions implementation of Matrix class
